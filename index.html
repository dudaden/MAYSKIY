   <h1>Description</h1>
   <p>I decided to make a portfolio about one of my work experience, for Russian Tea Company calling "Mayskiy". 
      This company and brand especially one of the main tea companies in Russia, 
      not the first year become best tea company of Russia and gets a lot of awards.</p> <br>
      <p>However, this company is not popular in Europe and still stays an unknown company, 
         this is the reason our team create design and some advertisement pictures for 
         Europe and English speaking people.</p> 
         <p>As a part of the team, I've been working with all facets of design including information architecture, 
            user task flows, visual, product, and prototyping. I also conducted user research using methods such as surveys, 
            and remote usability testing, in order to address user behavior and attitudes.</p>
         <br>
         <p>This company "Mayskiy" don't have an English website, 
            only for Russian speakers, so I worked as part of the team to create those mock-ups, pictures and styles.</p> <br>
            <h1>Website Mock-ups</h1>
            <p>All of those mock-ups as displayed below were created by myself. 
               The Main objective is to provide customers with good quality, sustainably produced tea from around the world.</p> <br>
               <p>To create my mock-ups I used pictures that we create, also some of the pictures company provided for us,
                  everything that is relevant to the "Mayskiy" tea company.</p>
